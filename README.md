This project focuses on developing a personalized recommendation system for movies and TV shows, akin to Netflix's approach. 
Using Python and machine learning techniques, the project aims to create a system that suggests content based on user preferences, leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle. 
The dataset includes comprehensive details such as titles, genres, ratings, and descriptions of Netflix content

Key DATA MINING techniques include data cleaning and preprocessing with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, such as NLTK, and the application of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for feature extraction. 
Cosine similarity is employed to measure the content's closeness for accurate recommendations
To enhance user interaction, the final system will be deployed with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and responsive UI. This project exemplifies the integration of data mining and web technologies to build a robust recommendation engine that mimics real-world applications
